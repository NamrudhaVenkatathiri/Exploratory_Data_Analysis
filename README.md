# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
EDA (exploratory data analysis) is a Data Science concept in which we examine a dataset in order to discover patterns, trends, and relationships. It helps us understand the data in the dataset and guides us in making informed decisions and establishing strategies to address real-world business problems.I used Python to conduct exploratory data analysis on this Instagram dataset.
